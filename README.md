System software for TIM011, a school computer from the end of 1980's made in former Yugoslavia

Based on BIOS 3.2 for Micromint SB180.

Commented thoroughly for (mostly) all the changes made to the original.

Original BIOS assembly files for SB180 are uploaded for reference, so you can make a diff between the modified BIOS and the originals.

I am not sure about the licensing. TIM011 is both software and hardware wise strongly based on SB180 single board computer from Micromint, amd uses ZRDOS and ZCPR3 by Echelon. No documentation has been ever made available from the manufacturer, Institute "Mihajlo Pupin" from Belgrade regarding system software. As a long time has passed since, I think nobody will object for the code to be available.
